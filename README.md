# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Bachelor of Technology student at Dayananda Sagar University with a keen interest in AI, ML, Data Science, and their applications in Astronomy, Sports, and Aerospace Engineering. As an experienced backend developer, I've honed my skills through internships at Bharat Intern and Oasis Infobyte, specializing in Python development.

My fascination lies in the potential of AI to revolutionize Aerospace Engineering, where I aim to optimize aircraft and spacecraft operations for enhanced safety and performance. Beyond technology, I'm an avid cricket enthusiast and sports journalism aficionado, blending analytical skills with storytelling.

I embrace diversity and am eager to contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology. Let's connect and explore opportunities for collaboration!
